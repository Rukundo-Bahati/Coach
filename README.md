        "python": "true",
        "javascript": "true",
        "semgrep": "true"
    },
    "dependencies": {
        "check_deps": "true",
        "auto_install": "false"
    },
    "tools": {
        "pylint": "true",
        "bandit": "true",
        "eslint": "true"
    }
}
```

### **Customization Options**
